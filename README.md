# YouTube History Data Analysis

This project aims to generate interesting insights about one's YouTube watch history data. With the data in hand, I performed data analysis and discovered viewing preferences and usage patterns based on the YouTube history data. 

[Check out](https://github.com/Johncarlodeveloper/YouTube-Watch-History-Data-Analysis/) how I extracted and stored YouTube videos' metadata in a CSV file.
